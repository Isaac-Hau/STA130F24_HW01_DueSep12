# # STA130 Week 01 Homework 
# 
# Please see the course [wiki-textbook](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/wiki) for the list of topics covered in this homework assignment, and a list of topics that might appear during ChatBot conversations which are "out of scope" for the purposes of this homework assignment (and hence can be safely ignored if encountered)
# 

# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Introduction</u></summary>
# 
# ### Introduction
#     
# A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. 
# Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.
# However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.
# 
# > Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a "realistic" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. 
# 
# It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to "do the work for you". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a "hint" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots "do the work for you", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>

# 
# ### Instructions
#     
# 1. Code and write all your answers (for both the "Prelecture" and "Postlecture" HW) in a python notebook (in code and markdown cells) 
#     
# > It is *suggested but not mandatory* that you complete the "Prelecture" HW prior to the Monday LEC since (a) all HW is due at the same time; but, (b) completing some of the HW early will mean better readiness for LEC and less of a "procrastentation cruch" towards the end of the week...
#     
# 2. Paste summaries of your ChatBot sessions (including link(s) to chat log histories if you're using ChatGPT) within your notebook
#     
# > Create summaries of your ChatBot sessions by using concluding prompts such as "Please provide a summary of our exchanges here so I can submit them as a record of our interactions as part of a homework assignment" or, "Please provide me with the final working verson of the code that we created together"
#     
# 3. Save your python jupyter notebook in your own account and "repo" on [github.com](github.com) and submit a link to that notebook though Quercus for assignment marking<br><br>

# 
# ### Prompt Engineering?    
#     
# The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are 
# 
# 1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, 
# 2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. 
# 
# In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a "hard reset" with a new initial approach to prompting.  Indeed, this is exactly the behavior [hardcoded into copilot](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/is-this-even-normal/0b6dcab3-7d6c-4373-8efe-d74158af3c00)...

# 
# - [0.1 points]: All relevant ChatBot summaries [including link(s) to chat log histories if you're using ChatGPT] are reported within the notebook
# - [0.2 points]: Reasonable well-written general definitions for Question "2.2"
# - [0.3 points]: Demonstrated understanding regarding Question "4"
# <!-- - [0.2 points]: A sensible justification for the choice in Question "7.4" -->
# - [0.4 points]: Requested assessment of ChatBot versus google performance in Question "8.3"
# 

# For questions 1-3: https://chatgpt.com/share/04e25d0d-e506-4062-a9c6-93eb1c411c63
# Summary:
# You provided a dataset about Animal Crossing characters and asked about the columns and data it contains. I explained the dataset has 391 rows and 13 columns, including attributes like name, species, and personality.
# 
# You requested definitions for "observations" and "variables" in the dataset context. I clarified that observations are individual entries (characters), and variables are columns representing attributes.
# 
# I provided Python code snippets for analyzing the dataset using df.describe() and df['column'].value_counts(), and corrected errors in your code.
# 
# You asked about missing values, and I provided code to check for them.
# 

# For questions 4-5: https://chatgpt.com/share/c7109ccc-0a46-4cf4-950a-df64f5db8b57
# 
# Summary: 
# 
# Checking for Missing Values in a Dataset:
# You provided a URL to a Titanic dataset hosted on GitHub and asked how to check for missing values.
# I explained how to load the dataset using Python's pandas library and provided code to identify missing values in each column using df.isnull().sum().
# Understanding Discrepancies Between df.shape and df.describe():
# 
# You asked about the differences in the number of columns reported by df.shape and df.describe().
# I explained that df.shape returns the total number of rows and columns, while df.describe() only includes numerical columns by default and excludes those with missing values.
# I provided code to demonstrate these differences using df.describe(include='all') to display statistics for all columns and df.isnull().sum() to check for missing values.
# Clarifying the Difference Between an Attribute and a Method:
# 
# You asked about the difference between an attribute and a method in object-oriented programming.
# I explained that:
# Attributes are variables that store data about an object, representing its state or properties.
# Methods are functions that define actions or behaviors that an object can perform.
# I provided examples in Python to illustrate both concepts.

# For questions 6-8.2: https://chatgpt.com/share/e54bf034-45a7-45d8-bda9-295834cda264
# 
# Summary: 
# 
# Introduction to Titanic Data Analysis:
# You mentioned that you are working with the Titanic dataset (available at: Titanic CSV) and need help understanding the code and analysis you're performing, especially considering the missing values in the dataset.
# Analysis Goals and Suggestions:
# 
# I suggested several initial data analysis tasks, including:
# Loading the dataset using Pandas.
# Displaying the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
# Checking data types and identifying missing values.
# Performing basic summary statistics using methods like .describe().
# Handling missing values using .isnull().sum().
# Explanation of df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe():
# 
# You asked for an explanation of the df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() code:
# df.groupby("col1"): Groups the DataFrame by the values in column col1.
# ["col2"]: Selects column col2 to perform the operation.
# .describe(): Computes summary statistics (like count, mean, std, min, max, etc.) for each group created by groupby().
# Demonstration Using a Different Dataset:
# 
# Instead of using the Titanic dataset, I demonstrated the same operation using the Iris dataset. The example grouped data by the species column and computed descriptive statistics for the sepal_length column.
# Code Example Using the Iris Dataset:
# 
# Provided a code example that loads the Iris dataset using Seaborn, groups by species, and computes descriptive statistics for sepal_length. The example illustrated how to apply the .groupby() and .describe() methods to summarize data.

# For question 8.3: https://chatgpt.com/share/554f45c0-a056-4985-9bcd-9faae2d8dd2f
# 
# Summary: 
# Introduction to Errors in Code:
# 
# You asked to intentionally introduce common coding errors and explore whether fixing them is easier using ChatGPT or by searching on Google.
# The goal was to analyze which method is faster or more effective in resolving different types of programming errors.
# Errors Introduced:
# 
# Forgetting to Import Libraries: Example: NameError: name 'pd' is not defined.
# Mistyping a Filename: Example: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'titanics.csv'.
# Using a Variable Before Assignment: Example: NameError: name 'DF' is not defined.
# Forgetting Parentheses in Function Calls: Example: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing.
# Mistyping a Function Name in a Chain: Examples: AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'group_by' and AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'describle'.
# Using a Non-Existent Column Name: Example: KeyError: 'Sex'.
# Forgetting to Quote Column Names: Example: NameError: name 'sex' is not defined.
# Troubleshooting with ChatGPT vs. Google:
# 
# Forgetting to Import Libraries: Both ChatGPT and Google are effective, with similar quick solutions.
# Mistyping a Filename: ChatGPT could be slightly faster by providing direct guidance on checking the filename or path.
# Using a Variable Before Assignment: ChatGPT quickly identifies the typo issue, potentially faster than finding the right answer on Google.
# Forgetting Parentheses in Function Calls: Both methods provide effective solutions, but ChatGPT might point out the exact issue more quickly.
# Mistyping a Function Name in a Chain: ChatGPT is likely more efficient in identifying typos directly.
# Using a Non-Existent Column Name: Both ChatGPT and Google offer useful solutions, but ChatGPT provides faster clarification.
# Forgetting to Quote Column Names: Both are effective, but ChatGPT provides a quicker response tailored to the context.
# Conclusion:
# 
# ChatGPT tends to be more efficient for context-specific or nuanced errors, providing tailored advice immediately.
# Google Search is also effective but may require more time to sift through multiple search results to find the relevant information.
# For simple, common errors, both ChatGPT and Google are equally effective, but ChatGPT can offer a faster, more streamlined experience overall.
# 

# ## "Pre-lecture" HW [*completion prior to next LEC is suggested but not mandatory*]

# #### 1. Pick one of the datasets from the ChatBot session(s) of the **TUT demo** (or from your own ChatBot session if you wish) and use the code produced through the ChatBot interactions to import the data and confirm that the dataset has missing values<br>
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > If your TA has not shared a relevant ChatBot session from their **TUT demo** through a piazza post and a Quercus announcement, the **TUT notebook** has links to example ChatBot sessions that you can use; or, ...
# > 
# > ```python
# > # feel free to just use the following if you prefer...
# > import pandas as pd
# > url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
# > df = pd.read_csv(url)
# > df.isna().sum()
# > ```
#     
# </details>

# I will be using the following link for my dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv
# Source attached in further guidance section of question 1.

# # 2. Start a new ChatBot session with an initial prompt introducing the dataset you're using and request help to determine how many columns and rows of data a `pandas` DataFrame has, and then
# 
# 1. use code provided in your ChatBot session to print out the number of rows and columns of the dataset; and,  
# 2. write your own general definitions of the meaning of "observations" and "variables" based on asking the ChatBot to explain these terms in the context of your dataset<br>
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > A good initial prompt to start would be be something like
# > - "I've downloaded a dataset about characters from animal crossings (from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv), and I'd like to know what columns of information I have and how much data I have"
# > 
# > You can further reduce the scope of your inquiry with if needed with something like
# > - "I've already downloaded the data and want to understand the size (or dimensions) of the dataset to start with"
# > 
# > *Some ChatBots can upload your data and do this for you; but, extended usage of this feature [likely requires a paid subscription](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/blob/main/CHATLOG/wk1/GPT/SLS/00006_gpt3p5_LoadDataPaywall.md); and, anyway, you need to run the code yourself rather than having a ChatBot do that for you; and, for STA130 we don't want a ChatBot to just do the analysis for us; rather, we instead want ChatBots to help us understand the steps we need to take to analyze the data; so,* **you DO NOT need to purchase an upgraded version of any ChatBots**
# > - Free-tier level ChatBots like [GPT4o-mini](https://chat.openai.com/) or [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (which is partially based on [ChatGPT4.0](https://chat.openai.com/), and which you have access to through your UofT account) are sufficiently sophisticated and perfectly appropriate for the STA130 course
#     
# </details>

# 1. After inquiring chatGPT to introduce the dataset, I've evaluated that the dataset contains 391 rows and 13 columns. These colomns  include information such as the characters' names, gender, species, personality, birthday, zodiac sign, initial phrase, initial clothes, skill, goal, coffee preference, style, and favorite song.
# 
# 2. In my own words, the observations refer to the rows of the dataset. In this case, the rows are the different characters. Variables refer to the colomns of the dataset, where the different variables of the characters are stores, such as their gener, species, birthday.
# 
# (chatGPT chatlong introduced at the start of the assignment alongside with questions 1-3)

# #### 3. Ask the ChatBot how you can provide simple summaries of the columns in the dataset and use the suggested code to provide these summaries for your dataset<br>
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > Use your ChatBot session to help you create working examples of using  `df.describe()` and `df['column'].value_counts()` for your dataset (although note that the `.value_counts()` method is not really meant to be used for numeric variables, so if you dataset has only numeric variables, `.value_counts()` might not be particularly informative...)
# >
# > #### ChatBot Response Scope 
# >     
# > If prompts are not sufficiently focused you will likely get overly broad responses from the ChatBot, but you can always respond with subsequent refinement requests to appropriately limit the scope of the ChatBot responses to focus on addressing your actual content targets; so, 
# > - an initially very general inquiry like, "I need help analyzing my data" will likely result in a ChatBot response suggesting a wide variety of approaches and techniques for summarizing your dataset; but, re-prompting the ChatBot with something like, "What's the simplest form of summarization of this dataset that I could do and how do I do it in Python?" or suggesting guidance using the specific summarization methods requested above will helpfully re-orient the ChatBot to your specific interests and needs
# > 
# > #### Jupyter Notebook Hints
# > 
# > Jupyter notebook printouts usaully don't show all of the data (when there's too much to show, like if `df.describe()` includes results for many columns), but the printouts just show enough of the data to give an idea of what the results are which is all we're looking for at the moment
# > 
# > - Consider dividing the code that ChatBot provides you into different jupyter notebook cells so that each cell concludes with a key printed result; the last line of code in a jupyter notebook cell will automatically print out in a formatted manner, so replacing something like `print(df.head())` with `df.head()` as the last line of a cell provides a sensible way to organize your code
# > - The printout suggestions above are demonstrated in `STA130F24_CourseProject.ipynb` if looking at an example would be helpful to understand what they're getting at...

The most common species is cat; the most frequent personality type is lazy. There are 204 male animals compared to the 187 female animals. The favourite song among the villagers is K.K. Country.

# #### 4. If the dataset you're using has (a) non-numeric variables and (b) missing values in numeric variables, explain (perhaps using help from a ChatBot if needed) the discrepancies between size of the dataset given by `df.shape` and what is reported by `df.describe()` with respect to (a) the number of columns it analyzes and (b) the values it reports in the "count" column<br>
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > If the dataset you're using does not have (a) non-numeric variables and (b) missing values in numeric variables (e.g., the `"villagers.csv"` example above has only a single numeric variable `row_n` which has no missing values), instead download and use the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv)" data to answer this question  
# >
# > In (a) above, the "columns it analyzes" refers to the columns of the output of `df.describe()` which will only include "numeric" columns by default, but you can can see the names of all the columns in a dataset using `df.columns`; and, make sure `df.shape` is refering to the dataset you think it is... if you've loaded a different dataset it might not have been called `df`(!)
# >
# > **If you get any errors (for example related to column names), copy and paste them as a response to the ChatBot, and see if it can help you resove them by adding the suggested adjustments to your code and then reruning all your code to see if the changes have fixed the problem (and repeat this process as needed until the problems have been resolved).**

# The code above, provided by chatGPT, there are several attributes with missing values, including age, embarked, deck, and embarked town. There are some code used to understand the discrepancies betwen the total size of the dataframe and the detail provided by describe(): 
# df.shape which provides the dimensions of the dataframe;
# df.describe() which provides statistics for numerical columns by default, including count, the number of non-null entries;
# df.describe(include='all') which provides statistics for all column including categorical ones;
# and df.isnull().sum() which shows the number of missing values for each column.

# #### 5. Use your ChatBot session to help understand the difference between the following and then provide your own paraphrasing summarization of that difference
# 
# - an "attribute", such as `df.shape` which does not end with `()`
# - and a "method", such as `df.describe()` which does end with `()` 
#    
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > The fact that a "method" such as `df.describe()` ends with `()` suggests that "methods" are essentially something that we would call a "function" in programming language terminology; but, without getting too technical or "in the weeds", it might also be worth considering that we could also contrast what the difference is between a "function" in a programming language versus a "function" in mathematics...

# With the help of chatGPT and summerizing the response in my own words, attributes refer to the variables that belong to a class or an object. They store data or state information about the object, thus, being accessable with dot notation without the brackets at the end. Methods are functions that belong to a class or an object. They define behaviors or actions that the object can perform. Attributes represent the state of an object, whereas methods represent the behavior or functionality of an object, thus, invoked or called with brackets.

# ### Prelecture VS Postlecture HW
#     
# Feel free to work on the "Postlecture" HW below if you're making good progress and want to continue: in this case this is particularly reasonable as questions "6" and "7" below directly follow up and extend the "Prelecture" HW questions
# 
# *The benefits of continue would are that (a) it might be fun to try to tackle the challenge of working through some problems without additional preparation or guidance; and (b) this is a very valable skill to be comfortable with; and (c) it will let you build experience interacting with ChatBots (and beginning to understand their strengths and limitations in this regard)... it's good to have sense of when using a ChatBot is the best way to figure something out, or if another approach (such as course provided resources or a plain old websearch for the right resourse) would be more effective*
#     
# </details>    
# 

# ## "Post-lecture" HW [*submission along with "Pre-lecture" HW is due prior to next TUT*]

# #### 6. The `df.describe()` method provides the 'count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', and 'max' summary statistics for each variable it analyzes. Give the definitions (perhaps using help from the ChatBot if needed) of each of these summary statistics<br>
# 
# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > The answers here actually make it obvious why these can only be calculated for numeric variables in a dataset, which should help explain the answer to "4(a)" and "4(b)" above
# >   
# > Also notice that when `df.describe()` is used missing values are not explicitly removed, but `df.describe()`  provides answers anyway. Is it clear what `df.describe()` does with the data in each columns it analyzes if there is missing data in the column in question? 
# >
# > The next questions addresses removing rows or columns from a dataset in order to explicitly remove the presense of any missingness in the dataset (assuming we're not going to fill in any missing data values using any missing data imputation methods, which are beyond the scope of STA130); so, the behavior of `df.describe()` hints that explicitly removing missing may not always be necessary; but, the concern, though, is that not all methods may be able to handle missing data the way `df.describe()` does...
#     
# </details>

# With the help of chatGPT, here are the definitions of each summary statistic provided by the df.describe() method:
# 
# Count: The number of non-null observations in the dataset for each variable. This tells you how many values are present, excluding any missing or NaN values.
# 
# Mean: The average value of the variable. It's calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of non-null observations.
# 
# Std: The standard deviation of the variable. It measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the values from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more spread out values.
# 
# Min: The minimum value in the dataset for the variable. This is the smallest value among all non-null observations.
# 
# 25%: The 25th percentile (or first quartile) of the variable. This means that 25% of the values are below this point, and 75% are above it.
# 
# 50%: The 50th percentile (or median) of the variable. It represents the middle value of the dataset, where half of the observations are below this value and half are above it.
# 
# 75%: The 75th percentile (or third quartile) of the variable. This indicates that 75% of the values are below this point, and 25% are above it.
# 
# Max: The maximum value in the dataset for the variable. This is the largest value among all non-null observations.

# #### 7. Missing data can be considered "across rows" or "down columns".  Consider how `df.dropna()` or `del df['col']` should be applied to most efficiently use the available non-missing data in your dataset and briefly answer the following questions in your own words
# 
# 1. Provide an example of a "use case" in which using `df.dropna()` might be peferred over using `del df['col']`<br><br>
#     
# 2. Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using `del df['col']` might be preferred over using `df.dropna()` <br><br>
#     
# 3. Discuss why applying `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()` when both are used together could be important<br><br>
#     
# 4. Remove all missing data from one of the datasets you're considering using some combination of `del df['col']` and/or `df.dropna()` and give a justification for your approach, including a "before and after" report of the results of your approach for your dataset.<br><br>

# <details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>Further Guidance</u></summary>
# 
# > Start a new ChatBot session **[but remember to first ask your ChatBot for summaries of your current session and perhaps coding results (so you can supply these in the homework as requested)]**, since your last ChatBot session has likely gotten quite long and has covered a lot of material at this point 
# > - It can sometimes be helpful to reset ChatBot sessions to refocus them on the topics of inquiry without too much backlog history that might unintentionally bias things in certain directions and, of course, you can always re-introduce material from earlier conversations as it's relevant, such as for answering "D" based on reintroducing and updating code you made in a previous ChatBot session.  
# > 
# > #### ChatBot Scope Guidance
# > 
# > - This question is not interested in the general benefits of imputing missing data, or the general benefits of using `df.dropna()` and/or `del df['col']` to remove missing data, just how to most efficiently remove missing data if a user chooses to do so
# > 
# > - More sophisticated analyses for "filling in" rather than removing missing data (as considered here) are possible (based on making assumptions about missing data and using specific imputation methods or models) but these are "beyond the scope" of this homework assignment so this topics can be safely ignored for now
# > 
# > #### ChatBot Code Troubleshooting
# > 
# > A key issue to be aware of when asking ChatBots for help with something is that they are not running and checking code for correctess, and they often intertwine written instructions with code instructions; so, BEFORE YOU RUN ANY CODE provided by a ChatBot, you should check the following
# > 
# > 1. If this code changes an object or data, are you sure you want to run this code?
# > 2. Can you easily "undo" the results of running code (e.g., from a copy `df_saved=df.copy()` or reloading the data) if running the code doesn't do what you want?
# > 3. Is the state of the data what is expected by the code? Or have the objects been updated and changed so they're no longer what the code expects them to be? 
# > 
# > #### If you get any `Python` errors, copy and paste them into the ChatBot prompt and see if it can help you resove them; but, keep in mind the final point above becasue the ChatBot might not be aware of the state of your objects relative to the code it's producing...

# 1.Imagine you are analyzing customer feedback for a product. Your dataset contains multiple columns, such as CustomerID, Feedback, Rating, and PurchaseDate. However, some rows have missing values in the Rating or PurchaseDate columns. To ensure your analysis of customer feedback is accurate and doesn't include incomplete data, you decide to remove rows with any missing values.

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Remove rows with any missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

print(df_cleaned)


# In this case, df.dropna() will remove rows where any column has missing values, resulting in a dataframe where all rows have complete information.
# 
# Continuing with the customer feedback dataset, if you realize that the PurchaseDate column is not necessary for your analysis and you want to remove it from the dataframe:

# In[23]:


import pandas as pd

# Sample dataframe
data = {
    'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'Feedback': ['Good', 'Excellent', 'Fair', 'Poor'],
    'Rating': [5, 4, 3, 2],
    'PurchaseDate': ['2024-01-01', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03', '2024-01-04']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Drop the 'PurchaseDate' column
del df['PurchaseDate']

print(df)


# In this case, del df['PurchaseDate'] removes the PurchaseDate column from the dataframe entirely, leaving you with only the columns you need for analysis.

# 2.Imagine you have a dataset with customer information that includes columns for CustomerID, Name, Email, Age, and Feedback. After reviewing the dataset, you decide that the Email column is not needed for your analysis and contains sensitive data that should be removed.

# In[24]:


import pandas as pd

# Sample dataframe
data = {
    'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', 'charlie@example.com', 'david@example.com'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
    'Feedback': ['Good', 'Excellent', 'Fair', 'Poor']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Drop the 'Email' column
del df['Email']

print(df)


# In this case, del df['Email'] is used to remove the Email column from the dataframe entirely. This action is preferred over df.dropna() because df.dropna() is not intended to remove columns but rather to handle missing values in rows. Removing the Email column is a matter of data management and relevance rather than cleaning up missing data.

# Summary
# df.dropna(): Used to remove rows with missing values, which is useful for cleaning data where incomplete rows are not useful for analysis.
# del df['col']: Used to remove entire columns, which is useful when certain columns are no longer needed or relevant to your analysis.

# 3.Applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() can be important for several reasons. 
# 
# Efficiency in Data Processing
# 
# -Memory Usage: If a column contains a large number of missing values, removing it first can reduce the size of the dataframe, potentially saving memory and speeding up the dropna() operation.
# 
# -Performance: Dropping unnecessary columns before applying dropna() can improve performance, especially with large datasets. This is because dropna() will not need to process the data in the removed columns.
# 
# Relevance of Analysis
# 
# -Focus on Relevant Data: By removing columns that are irrelevant or not needed before handling missing values, you ensure that your analysis focuses only on the columns that matter. This prevents the risk of accidentally removing rows based on columns that don’t contribute to your analysis.
# 
# -Cleaner Results: If a column has a high proportion of missing values and is not critical for your analysis, removing it first ensures that dropna() only affects the columns that are truly relevant, leading to more meaningful results.
# 
# Simplification of Data Cleaning
# 
# -Streamlined Process: Removing unnecessary columns first simplifies the cleaning process. It ensures that dropna() is applied to a more manageable and relevant subset of columns, making it easier to understand and manage the remaining data.
# 
# -Avoiding Unintended Consequences: Applying dropna() before removing unnecessary columns could lead to unintended data loss if those columns are mistakenly included in the drop process. By removing irrelevant columns first, you reduce the risk of such errors.

# 4. Sample Dataset:
# We have a dataset with some missing values:

# In[6]:


import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'],
    'Email': ['alice@example.com', None, 'charlie@example.com', 'david@example.com', None],
    'Age': [25, None, 35, 40, None],
    'Feedback': ['Good', None, 'Fair', 'Poor', None]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# The initial dataset looks like this:

# In[26]:


print("Before cleaning:")
print(df)


# Approach to Data Cleaning
# Remove Columns with High Proportion of Missing Values
# 
# Suppose Email is not crucial for our analysis, and we decide to remove it first with del df['Email']. 
# 
# Remove Rows with Missing Values
# After removing Email, we handle missing data in the remaining columns using df.dropna(). df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# 

# In[27]:


del df['Email']
df_cleaned = df.dropna()
print("After cleaning:")
print(df_cleaned)


# Justification for Approach
# 
# Removing Columns First:
# 
# The Email column was removed because it had many missing values and was deemed irrelevant for the analysis. By removing this column, we streamline the dataset and avoid unnecessary processing of irrelevant data.
# 
# Handling Missing Data:
# 
# After removing the irrelevant column, df.dropna() was used to remove rows with any remaining missing values in the relevant columns (CustomerID, Name, Age, Feedback). This ensures that our analysis only includes complete rows with valid data.
# 
# Summary
# 
# Before Cleaning: The dataset contained columns with missing values and had rows with incomplete information.
# 
# After Cleaning: We removed the Email column and dropped rows with missing values, resulting in a dataset with only complete rows and relevant columns.
# 
# This approach ensures that our analysis is based on a clean and focused dataset, enhancing the quality and reliability of the results.

# #### 8. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below
# 
# > This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv" data set 
# > 
# > To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from "2" above
# > - "I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing"
#         
# 1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the "titanic" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you
#     
# > If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)
#     
# 2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question "7" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()`?
# 
# > Questions "4" and "6" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).
# 
# 3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>
#     
#     1. Forget to include `import pandas as pd` in your code 
#        <br> 
#        Use Kernel->Restart from the notebook menu to restart the jupyter notebook session unload imported libraries and start over so you can create this error
#        <br><br>
#        When python has an error, it sometimes provides a lot of "stack trace" output, but that's not usually very important for troubleshooting. For this problem for example, all you need to share with ChatGPT or search on google is `"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined"`<br><br>
# 
#     2. Mistype "titanic.csv" as "titanics.csv"
#        <br> 
#        If ChatBot troubleshooting is based on downloading the file, just replace the whole url with "titanics.csv" and try to troubleshoot the subsequent `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'titanics.csv'` (assuming the file is indeed not present)
#        <br><br>
#        Explore introducing typos into a couple other parts of the url and note the slightly different errors this produces<br><br>
#       
#     3. Try to use a dataframe before it's been assigned into the variable
#        <br> 
#        You can simulate this by just misnaming the variable. For example, if you should write `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()` based on how you loaded the data, then instead write `DF.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()`
#        <br><br>
#        Make sure you've fixed your file name so that's not the error any more<br><br>
#         
#     4. Forget one of the parentheses somewhere the code
#        <br>
#        For example, if the code should be `pd.read_csv(url)` the change it to `pd.read_csv(url`<br><br>
#         
#     5. Mistype one of the names of the chained functions with the code 
#        <br>
#        For example, try something like `df.group_by("col1")["col2"].describe()` and `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describle()`<br><br>
#         
#     6. Use a column name that's not in your data for the `groupby` and column selection 
#        <br>
#        For example, try capitalizing the columns for example replacing "sex" with "Sex" in `titanic_df.groupby("sex")["age"].describe()`, and then instead introducing the same error of "age"<br><br>
#         
#     7. Forget to put the column name as a string in quotes for the `groupby` and column selection, and see if the ChatBot and google are still as helpful as they were for the previous question
#        <br>
#        For example, something like `titanic_df.groupby(sex)["age"].describe()`, and then `titanic_df.groupby("sex")[age].describe()`
#         
# 

# 1.The df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() function performs a grouped summary statistics operation in Pandas. 
# Example Code: Grouping by Species and Describing Sepal Length
# We will group by the species column and compute summary statistics for the sepal_length column.

# In[2]:


import seaborn as sns

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

# Group by 'species' and describe the 'sepal_length' column
sepal_length_summary = iris.groupby("species")["sepal_length"].describe()

print(sepal_length_summary)


# The output provides a summary table showing the count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and the max, allowing us to quickly understand the distribution of the sepal_length for each species in the dataset.

# 2.df.describe() captures the overall completeness of the dataset, providing a high-level view of missingness across all rows in the dataframe for each column. 
# 
# df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() captures the distribution and missingness of data within each specific segment or group defined by col1. It provides a more granular view, highlighting patterns or differences in missingness or data distribution between different groups.

# In[8]:


import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Department': ['HR', 'IT', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'HR', 'Finance'],
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'Salary': [50000, 70000, None, 80000, 60000, None, 90000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# In[9]:


print(df.describe())


# In[10]:


print(df.groupby("Department")["Salary"].describe())


# Fundamental Difference Between the Two count Values
# 
# df.describe(): The count reflects the total number of non-missing values for each column across the entire dataframe. This gives a broad picture of how complete each column's data is, regardless of any specific grouping.
# 
# df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe(): The count reflects the number of non-missing values of col2 within each subgroup defined by col1. This is more granular and shows how the data completeness and distribution differ across different groups or categories.
# 
# 
# Why This Difference Matters
# 
# Understanding Overall Missingness: df.describe() helps you understand the overall completeness of each column, giving you a sense of which columns might need attention due to missing values.
# 
# Exploring Patterns Within Groups: df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() helps identify patterns, trends, or issues with missing data within specific groups. For example, if certain departments (like HR in our example) have more missing Salary data than others, this might suggest data entry issues or other problems specific to that group.
# 
# 
# By using both approaches, you can get a complete understanding of your data's quality and structure, both at a high level and within specific segments.

# 3.It's easier to work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors than usi google to search for and fix errors. This is due to chatGPT being able to analyze the data and provide a fixed code to just copy and paste into my old code with errors. Google is not able to do this due to its inability to understand the error. You would only input your topic to search and it will response based on websites and data uploaded to google. Therefore, comparing the troubleshooting ability of the two applications, chatGPT win by a huge margin.
# 
# For example E: Mistype one of the names of the chained functions with the code

# In[11]:


df.group_by("col1")["col2"].describe()
df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describle()


# This will cause the error:
# 
# AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'group_by'
# 
# ChatGPT Troubleshooting:
# 
# ChatGPT would likely suggest checking the function names (group_by should be groupby and describle should be describe).
# It would explain that the error indicates a non-existent method or typo.
# 
# Google Search Troubleshooting:
# Searching for AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'group_by' or AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'describle' would also lead to similar answers.
# 
# 
# Overall Conclusion:
# 
# For most of these errors, ChatGPT can provide solutions faster and with more tailored advice based on the specific error messages and context provided. Google searches can also be effective but might require more time to sift through search results and find the relevant information.
# 
# If the errors are simple and common (e.g., forgetting to import a library), both methods are equally effective. For more context-specific issues or when dealing with nuanced errors, ChatGPT tends to be more efficient because it offers instant feedback and tailored advice.

# #### 9. Have you reviewed the course [wiki-textbook](https://github.com/pointOfive/stat130chat130/wiki) and interacted with a ChatBot (or, if that wasn't sufficient, real people in the course piazza discussion board or TA office hours) to help you understand all the material in the tutorial and lecture that you didn't quite follow when you first saw it?<br>

# ### Afterward
# 
# Here are few ideas of some other kinds of interactions you might consider exploring with a ChatBot...
# 
# > While these are likely to be extremely practically valuable, they are not a part of the homework assignment, so do not include anything related to these in your homework submission
# 
# - With respect to improving ones ability in statistics, coding, communication, and other key data science skills
#     - what is the ChatBots perception its own capabilities and uses as an AI-driven assistance tool 
#     - and does ChatBots assessment of itself influence or agree with your own evalution of the ChatBot? 
# 
# - ChatBots can introduce and explain the "World War 2 planes" problem and the "Monte Hall" problem... 
#     - how well does do they seem to do and introducing and explaining other "unintuitive surprising statistics paradoxes"?
# 
# - If you consider the process of writing about why you chose to take this course, and the skills you were hoping to build through this course with respect to your current ideas about what possible careers 
#     - and how do you think the exercise would be different if you framed it as a dialogue with a ChatBot
#     - and do you think the difference could be positive and productive, or potentially biasing and distracting?
#     
# - ChatBots sometimes immediately responds in simple helpful ways, but other times it gives a lot of extraneous information that can be overwheling... are you able to prompt and interact with ChatBots in manner that keeps its reponses helpful and focused on what you're interested in? 
# 
# - ChatBots tends to respond in a fairly empathetic and supportive tone...
#     - do you find it helpful to discuss concerns you might have about succeeding in the course (or entering university more generally) with a ChatBot?
#     
# - For what purposes and in what contexts do you think a ChatBot could provide suggestions or feedback about your experiences that might be useful? 
#
